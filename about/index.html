			<ul>
				<li><b>Establishing life-long relationships.</b> When we emptied out our pockets to start Life Changing Labs our focus was not on any potential future return on investment. Our goal has always been to build long-term relationships with talented individuals who we view as our partners, rather than as employees or students. We are big on loyalty, which extends beyond the time spent with us and the startups we work on together. Whether continuing work with LCL, or launching a new venture years down the road, LCL members will find support in our network.</li>
				<li><b>Learning from experienced entrepreneurs.</b> Entrepreneurs in our network have spent years launching and growing companies. Through their successes and failures, they have a wealth of knowledge to share. We believe there is as much to learn from failure as there is from success, and encourage our associates to leverage those experiences in building their own success stories.</li>
				<li><b>3 Ps – People, Passion, and Persistence.</b> Behind every successful company you will find an amazing group of people with great passion for what they do. What separates the winners and losers in entrepreneurship is the persistence displayed by these passionate individuals. We carefully select team members who exemplify these traits.</li>
				<li><b>Maximizing our time by focusing on strengths.</b> The most valuable asset we have is time, and we make the most of the time we get to spend together. We help our members prioritize efficiently and effectively by focusing on their strengths.  We take care of tedious and time-consuming administration work so founders can spend more time building and creating.</li>
				<li><b>Our network is forever growing.</b> Talented individuals are constantly reaching out to join the LCL network and collaborate with us. As our network and community grows the resources available to everyone increases.</li>

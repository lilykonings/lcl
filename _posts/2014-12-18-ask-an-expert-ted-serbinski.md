Life Changing Labs is proud to announce our new Ask-an-Expert Interview Series. In the Ask an Expert blog and podcast series, we interview Cornellian investors and entrepreneurs. We source our questions from startups and all the questions are tailored to the expert being interviewed. Our interviewees span a wide range of industries and academic backgrounds but they are all heavy-hitters in their own right. We hope you find the interviews as enjoyable as the experience we had conducting them! Please send us feedback so we can better improve the quality of the interviews and let us know if you'd like to submit questions in the future.

We were thrilled to have Ted Serbinski, partner of Detroit Venture Partners, as our first guest speaker.

In 2011, he relocated to Detroit from San Francisco, joining Detroit Venture Partners as vice president, after having sold his company to Lifetime Television in 2008.

<br>
**Name:** Luke Goodman\\
**Hometown:** Long Beach, NY\\
**Class and Major:** Information Science, Class of 2016\\
**Hobbies/Interests:** Basketball, volleyball, enology, crossword puzzles
**Favorite Quote:** "So it goes." -Kurt Vonnegut\\
**Why did you join LCL?** I joined LCL to gain work experience, learn more about programming and designing with a team for clients, build a portfolio, and spend another beautiful summer in Ithaca.\\
**What do you consider to be life changing?** I consider life changing to be synonomous with perception changing. Anything that alters somebody's life, whether it be community service or a tragedy or something else, alters their stance on the world around them. A change in life is all about a change in mood; if somebody decides that today will be a good day and that they will accomplish something today, then, barring any disaster or act of God, it will be a good day and they will accomplish something. For the most part, a person decides if their life is going to change and how it is going to change, negatively or positively.\\
**What inspires you?** I believe that spending time with my friends is the greatest source of inspiration, but watching basketball, at almost any level, is definitely a big one for me as well.

**Favorite Quote:** God has made best arrangement for everyone.\\
**Why did you join LCL?** I joined LCL to get hands-on experience with start-ups and entrepreneurship. Also, a reason to stay for a lovely summer in Ithaca.\\
**What do you consider to be life changing?** Life changing, to me, is about taking a less taken path. For example, taking a volunteer trip to another country or joining an organization that few people in your friend group joined.\\
**What inspires you?** I got inspiration from reading people’s biographies.  I also get inspiration from talking to friends and family members.

**What inspires you?** I derive inspiration from people who are the best at what I do. There’s nothing more rewarding than learning from those who have already mastered a subject, and challenging myself to match the quality of their work.
